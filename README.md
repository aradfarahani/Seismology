## Introduction

The **Seismology** project harnesses the power of machine learning to revolutionize seismic data analysis. Our mission is to develop robust algorithms and tools that improve the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of earthquake detection and seismic event characterization, benefiting researchers, scientists, and disaster preparedness efforts worldwide.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Streamlined tools for cleaning, formatting, and preparing seismic datasets.
- **Machine Learning Models**: State-of-the-art ML implementations for detecting and classifying seismic events.
- **Visualization**: Interactive and insightful visualizations of seismic data and model predictions.
- **Benchmarking**: Standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarks to assess model performance.

## Data Sources

This project leverages the following publicly available datasets:

- **[ObsPy Seismic Data](https://examples.obspy.org/RJOB_061005_072159.ehz.new)**: Sample seismic waveforms for testing and development.
- **[USGS Earthquake Data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/2.5_month.csv)**: Real-time and historical earthquake records (magnitude 2.5+ over the past month).

Additional datasets may be integrated as the project evolves—stay tuned!

## Installation

To set up the **Seismology** project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aradfarahani/Seismology.git
