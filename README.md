## Introduction

Seismology is a project aimed at leveraging machine learning to enhance the analysis of seismic data. By utilizing advanced algorithms, we aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of earthquake detection and characterization.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Tools for cleaning and preparing seismic data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various ML models for seismic event detection and classification.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing seismic data and model outputs.
- **Benchmarking**: Standardized benchmarks for evaluating model performance.

## Data Sources

This project utilizes the following data sources:

- [Seismic data from ObsPy](https://examples.obspy.org/RJOB_061005_072159.ehz.new)
- [Earthquake data from USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/2.5_month.csv)
